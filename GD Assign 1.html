<h2> <em>Scope: </em> </h2>
<p>
 Our game will be based on creating an action and adventure game with entertainment purposes. The scope of the development of this game is divided in to small cycles which includes the following things:
 <ol type="1">
 <li>The first version will start by creating and developing the basic foundations of the game such as the game environment, basic resources e.g., sprites, means of transportation etc. The process will furthur be complexed as the more resources require more sprites, scenes and levels. </li>
 <li> The game is single player game, as we only have one main character who will find the infinity stones and will protect it from enemies and there will be a ENEMY who will try to defeat the main character and to steal the infinity stones.</li>
 <li>The game will be developed using unity and the scripts will be written in C# Visual studio. All the sprites will be taken from internet.</li>
 <li>Character development will not be the part of our game, we will use the resources mainly from internet and the basic functios like running, walking, fighting and finding stones will be done by the main character.</li>
 <li>We'll be working mainly with story, levels, object animation, graphics, scripts and game engine facilities. </li>
 <li>We will not be working on cartoon making or on web modules  i.e., our game will not be deployed on website.</li>
